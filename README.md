# AWS S3 - Prime Academy Weekend Spike

This challenge tasked me with finding a solution for handling image upload from the client.

## The Problem

Uploading images is essential in basically every functional and user friendly application.

While it is possible to store image files on a local host, and the path to the image in PostgreSQL.. There exists a faster and much more scalable method.

## The Solution

AWS S3 allows you to send image data thru nodejs and store the data on the cloud.
